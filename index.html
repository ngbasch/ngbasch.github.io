                <h3>About Me</h3>
            </header>
            <p>I am a Data Scientist working at the intersection of economics, statistics, and sustainability. I tend to thrive in cross-functional roles with complex and ambiguous business problems. My career started in economic consulting [link to Brattle], where I developed statistical models and economic testimony for litigation. More recently at Indigo Ag [link to Indigo], I develop machine learning models to quantify field-scale agricultural emissions based on satellite imagery. I enjoy working with non-data experts to translate their (often-overlooked) subject matter expertise into useful tools and models.

            More detailed career information is available on my resume [link to resume].
