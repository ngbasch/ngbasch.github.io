As part of Indigo's hiring process, I built an interactive [map](https://ngbasch.shinyapps.io/Indigo/) in R Shiny to visualize USDA NASS agricultural data.

The app contains three core tabs:
- A U.S. choropleth showing county-level rates of area planted, area harvested, or yield, with filters for crop and year.
- An interactive plot viewer allowing user to visualize various year-over-year trends.
- A data table with column filters 

Code to process and clean NASS data as well as generate the app can be found on a GitHub Repository [here](https://github.com/ngbasch/indigo-case). The map was heavily inspired (and styling was lifted) from the [SuperZip Shiny App](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/063-superzip-example/).
